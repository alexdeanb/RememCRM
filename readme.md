## Lessons Learned

- Although it takes time, writing your API is very pattern-based. Knock it out, but be mindful of the small things.
- Two weeks is not much time, dream big, and try to get there. Know it's okay if you don't get every little feature in.
- Rubber ducks are very important. Sometimes you'll solve an issue just by talking about it.
